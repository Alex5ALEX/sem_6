     Model Summary:

     Number of elements                    =      2025
     Total number of conductances          =      5940
     Number of linear conductances         =      5940
     Number of boundary elements           =      1605

     Note: During the analysis process a number of elements have been
     created whose labels you may not recognize. To find out more about
     these elements and the elements they are associated with, please
