     Model Summary:

     Number of elements                    =       601
     Total number of conductances          =      1700
     Number of linear conductances         =      1500
     Number of convective conductances     =       200
     Number of boundary elements           =        99

     Note: During the analysis process a number of elements have been
     created whose labels you may not recognize. To find out more about
     these elements and the elements they are associated with, please
